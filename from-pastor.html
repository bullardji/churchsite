                    <h3 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">The Reverend Aaron E. Yaeger, Pastor</h3>
                    <p class="" style="text-align: left;""><em>Pastor Yaeger has served the saints of Our Savior since his ordination and installation here on the sixth Sunday after Trinity in the year of our Lord 2017.</em></p>
                </div>

He thought for a moment and answered, "Jesus." His answer was more profound than he knew. Jesus is the Good Shepherd; I am simply privileged to be an undershepherd serving Christ's sheep. So before I tell you who I am, I want to say I hope you are visiting our website to know that Jesus serves the people gathered at Our Savior. And although I am happy to share a few things about myself, it’s not about me! This is illustrated by the vestments I wear which cover my individuality and the stole which represents the yoke of God's Word, to which I am bound.</p>
                    <p class="" style="text-align: left;">After being primarily home schooled, I received a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Applied Physics from Grove City College in 2009. Entering Concordia Theological Seminary, Ft Wayne, IN, in 2012, I met my wife, Diana, during her second year of the deaconess program. Married the following year, we now have five children. In my free time I enjoy being with my family; together we garden, camp, bike, hike, read, and spend lots of time being silly.</p>
                    <p class="" style="text-align: left;">For more information on our congregation, please see our <a href="communion">statement on Holy Communion</a> or <a href="https://calendly.com/pastoryaeger" target="_blank">schedule a time</a> to visit with me.&nbsp;When you visit us, I look forward to meeting with you and rejoice to receive our Lord's gifts together. The peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Rev. R. Eric Malmstrom, Associate Pastor</h3>
                    <p class="" style="text-align: left;"><em>Pastor Malmstrom has served the saint at Our Savior since he was installed here on the Third Sunday after Epiphany, in the year of our Lord 2022.</em>

Malmstrom was born in Mountain View, California, and grew up in the surrounding area. His theological studies began at Concordia University Irvine. After two years of college, he enlisted in the US Navy and served as a Nuclear Electrician’s Mate. He served on board the USS Haddock (SSN-621) home ported out of San Diego, and later Honolulu, Hawaii. After concluding his enlistment, Rev. Malmstrom completed undergraduate studies at Concordia Irvine and continued his studies at Concordia Theological Seminary, Fort Wayne, Indiana, graduating in May 2000. In 2006, Concordia Irvine awarded him Alumnus of the Year.</p>
                        <p class="" style="text-align: left;">Rev. Malmstrom was ordained into the Office of the Holy Ministry on 9 July 2000. He served churches in southern California and Indiana before receiving a call from the LCMS Ministry to the Armed Forces. He returned to Active Duty in the Navy Chaplain Corps until his retirement in 2021. During his time as chaplain, he served with the US Marine Corps in Iraq and Afghanistan, specializing in Clinical Pastoral Care and serving as a hospital chaplain. He also served as a district chaplain for the US Coast Guard.

                        <p style="text-align: left;">
                            Rev. Malmstrom is married to Leslie, and their three adult sons, Thomas, Timothy, and Samuel, currently attend Liberty University.</p>
